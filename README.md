Gapi is a serverless game api. It is a sample of how to use serverless and it is also the base for an idea I have had. 

#Install
Pull the code and create a admin.env file in the root account. This file will need the following

```
SERVERLESS_ADMIN_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={your access key}
SERVERLESS_ADMIN_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={your secret key}
```
The run

```
serverless resource deploy
```
